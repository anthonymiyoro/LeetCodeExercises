## Question
Given a string s and an int k, return an int representing the number of substrings (not unique) of s with exactly k distinct characters. If the given string doesn't have k distinct characters, return 0.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "pqpqs", k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: ["pq", "pqp", "pqpq", "qp", "qpq", "pq", "qs"]

```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aabab", k = 3
Output: 0
```
Constraints:

The input string consists of only lowercase English letters [a-z]
0 ≤ k ≤ 26



## Proposed Solution

- Check if ther are  K distinct characters in string
- Loop through string starting from 1st char collecting substrings until no more k distinct characers thne on to next char
-
